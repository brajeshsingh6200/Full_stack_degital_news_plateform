## 📘 Project Title: **Digital News Portal – Flask-Based News Aggregator**

### 📝 Project Description:

**Digital News Portal** is a full-stack web application built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)** and **Flask (Backend)** with a **MongoDB/SQLite database**. The application fetches the latest news from multiple categories (e.g., Technology, Sports, Politics, Entertainment) using the **NewsAPI.org** and displays them in a user-friendly interface.

The portal supports both dynamic news fetching via external APIs as well as manual article management via an **admin panel** where the admin can add, update, or delete custom news posts.

### 🎯 Key Features:

#### 📰 News Fetching (Live & Dynamic):

* Fetches real-time news articles from NewsAPI.org (using predefined categories like tech, health, sports).
* API integration using Python `requests` module.

#### 🔎 Search Functionality:

* Users can search news articles using keywords.
* The search is applied to both live API news and admin-created custom news.

#### 📂 Category Filtering:

* News is grouped and filtered based on categories such as:

  * Technology
  * Politics
  * Sports
  * Health
  * Business

#### 🛠️ Admin Panel:

* Admin login authentication.
* Admin can:

  * Create articles
  * Edit articles
  * Delete articles
* Admin-created news is stored in a local MongoDB/SQLite database.

#### 💬 Optional Features:

* Comment section for each article using local DB
* Text-to-Speech integration (using `pyttsx3` or browser TTS API)
* Pagination and responsive UI

### 🔐 API Key

You can get your free API key by registering at:

👉 [https://newsapi.org/register](https://newsapi.org/register)

Once you register, you’ll receive a free API key via email.
Then you can use it in your Flask app like this:

```python
import requests

NEWS_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
url = f"https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&category=technology&apiKey={NEWS_API_KEY}"

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()
```

If you don't have an API key, you can:

* Use static sample JSON data to simulate API response (for demo)
* Or use a dummy key: `"test_api_key"` (but this will not fetch real news)

---

### 🚀 How It Works

1. User lands on homepage → sees live news and custom news
2. Can filter by category or search
3. Admin can log in → go to dashboard → create/edit/delete news articles
4. Optional: Text-to-speech reads news aloud or comments can be added

### 🧠 Skills You Will Demonstrate

* Flask routing, Jinja templating
* HTML/CSS + Bootstrap styling
* News API integration with Python
* Database CRUD using MongoDB or SQLite
* REST API usage and security practices
